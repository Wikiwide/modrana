= Intro =
Each theme is represented with its own folder.
Name of the folder is used as theme name.
The theme folder can contain icons and the theme.conf configuration file
for setting colors of the GUI components.
For more info about the theme configuration file,
see the self-documented theme.conf in the default theme.

= How icon loading works ? =
Icons are first looked up in the current theme folder, if not available
the default folder is looked up. If no icon is found in both folders,
a generic icon is used.

= What image formats can the icons be in ? =
Currently only PNG is supported, but support for other bitmap formats and SVG is planed.
When deciding on icon resolution, look on the resolution of the default icons,
icons are always scaled to fit the current icon size.

= Where are the source SVG files for the default icons ? =
Due to package size & as to have a separate Git history,
the source SVG file is in a separate Git repository:
https://github.com/M4rtinK/modrana-graphics

This repository also has scripts fir regenerating the icons
after changing the SVG file.
